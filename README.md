# Sudoku Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem  
**By: William Kopec**  
This program uses Constraint Satisfaction Problem to solve any possible sudoku solution. It uses consistency checking (Function: isPossibleValue) and backtracking  
(Function: solveSudokuBoard) to efficiently solve the board. A helper method called isNumeric() is used to check whether the value at some position on the board is  
a valid value (1-9), otherwise set the value as an empty position (0).
